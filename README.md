##### Hallo Dev Team! :D

Okay This Is The Base Project That We Will Be Working On (Backend-Wise + Frontend-Wise)
We will be using TypeScript mainly in this project!

Make sure you write clean code as much as possible and comment everything in a good way!
(functionality, use case, and parameters) also if possible where would it be used in the front end & vice versa!

*Thank You* <3
- Please Make Sure You Run the Backend Using: "npm run start:dev" to Get The Benifits of Using Nodemon
- Run Frontend Using: "npm run dev"

##### Hallo Again Dev Team! ^^

Let Me Start Of With A Congrats On Finishing The 2nd Milestone Before The Deadline While Learning Alot About NestJs And Mongo!<br>
Now Its The UI Phase (WE ARE DOOMED) :D

Tasks Will Be Assigned Same As Last Time Where Each One Of U Will Be Responsible For A Specific Page Or 2 To Implement!
<br>(Functional Wise Not Visually)<br>
The Main Frame Will Be Done Soon So you Guys Can Start In Working On The Connections Between The Interface And The Backend Soon!<br>
To Run the Front End As A Reminder Use The Command **"npm run dev"** And Make Sure $${\color{red}You \space ARE \space In \space The \space "FrontEnd" \space Folder}$$
First Or It Wont Work!

- Abdelrahman Will Be The One Responsible For Assigning The Pages So Return To Him On That Matter!<br>
- Please Be As Fast As Possible In Ur Work Even If Its Not Fully Functional So Me And Youssef Can Help!<br>
- We Are Planning To Have A Good UI And Deploy Everything If Possible To Finish This Milestone On A Good Note Same As Last One sooo..

### Finish As Fast As Possible!

Abdelrahman Wont Be Responsible For The FrontEnd Unlike Before But Will Still Keep Up With Us During The Whole Process To Tweek The Backend Based On needs.. He Will Still Work On A Page Himself Or 2<br>

You Can Return To Me Or Youssef From Now On If You Need Help :D
